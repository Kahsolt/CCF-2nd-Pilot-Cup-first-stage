# Problem 2: HHL Algorithm

----

### Problem & Analysis

Solving a linear equation `A * x = b` in a quantum computaional manner, where `A` is an **arbitary** square matrix and `b` is an **arbitary** vector with matching dimension. For a simple example:

```
Solving Ax = b where A is
  [   1,     1]
  [1/âˆš2, -1/âˆš2]
and b is
  [ 1/ 2]
  [-1/âˆš2]

The solution is unique:
  [-1/4]
  [ 3/4]
```

From linear algebra basics, we know that the solution `x` might be nothing, unique, or an ensemble, depending on the rank of the expanded matrix `[A|b]`. In **any of these cases** noted, we can apply the [Gaussian Elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination) method or [Matrix Inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix) to get the accurate answer, but naive implementations cost time of `O(n^2)`, while the most optimized classical algorithm reduces it to `O(N*sqrt(k))`, where `k` describes the cost for inversing the matrix. However, in **case of unique solution**, we have another perspective view and thoughts upon form of the linear equation, where is also probably the [HHL Alogrithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3171) derives. ðŸ˜€

In quantum computation traditions, `U` denotes a quantum gate and `|phi>` denotes a quantum state, when `U` is applied to `|phi>`, it turns to be a new state, say `U |phi> -> |psi>`. Corresponding to the physical process the story is that, a quantum particle **evolves** its state from `|phi>` to `|psi>` under the environment influence `U`. Compared with the linear equation `A * x = b`, now it's easy to figure out the logical structure in parallel:

```
quantum evolution:  U |phi> -> |psi>
  linear equation:  A   x   =    b

where U and A are square matrices, others are all vectors in computational representation
```

â„¹ From this view, solving a linear equation is like to **finding the initilal state of a quantum evolution process** where the final state is known to be `|psi>` while the evolution operator is `U`. Due to the **reversible computing** nature of quantum computating, this is not a magic in philosophical sense. ðŸ˜‰


### Solution

Now it's clear enough to put an elephant into the refrigerator:

  - Encode classical `A` and `b` to quantum `U` and `|psi>`
    - âš  tricky: find ways to satisfy the required `unitary & unit vector` condition for `A` and `b`
  - Find `|phi>` through matrix inversion of `U`, aka. computing the reversed `|phi> = Uâ€ |psi>`
    - âš  tricky: do not directly inverse `U`, but instead decompose `|psi>` to `U`'s eigen vectors, then simply inverse the eigen values ðŸ¥´
  - Decode `|phi>` to get the solution `x` (in a probablistic approximated sense)

Assuming `dim(A) = rand(A) = 2`, we implement & explain the HHL Alogrithm step by step in folloing sections, but firstly here's a outline sketch for looking ahead.

```
A|x> = |b>                    // assume A is an invertibe hermitian (no need be unitary), and |b> is a unit vector
 |x> = A^(-1) |b>
     = Î£i 1/Î»i |vi><vi| |b>              // eigen decomposition of A^(-1) where Î»i and |vi> are the i-th eigen pair of A
     = (Î£i 1/Î»i |vi><vi|) (Î£j Î²j |vj>)   // decompose |b> to A's eigen basis |vi>; i,j âˆˆ [0, N-1], N = dim(A)
     = Î£iÎ£j Î²j/Î»i |vi><vi|vj>
     = Î£iÎ£j Î²j/Î»i |vi>                   // <vi|vj> == 1 if i==j else 0
     = Î£i (Î£j Î²j) 1/Î»i |vi>              // aggregate inner const coeffs
     = Î£i Î²i/Î»i |vi>                     // rename, Î²i only depends on i

QPE_2(A, |00b>)               // estimates eigen value of A over vector |b>, using two ancilla qubits inited as |00>
  = C_02(U^2^0) * C_12(U^2^1) * (H @ H @ I) |00b>     // |q0,q1,q2>, C_ij(U) denotes controlled-unitary U on |qi> over |qj>
  = C_02(U^2^0) * C_12(U^2^1) * |++b>                 // |+> = H|0> 
  = C_02(U^2^0) * C_12(U^2^1) * |+>(|0>+|1>)|b>       // ignore global phase
  = C_02(U^2^0) * |+>(|0b>+|1>U^2|b>)
  = C_02(U^2^0) * (|0>+|1>)(|0b>+|1>U^2|b>)
  = C_02(U^2^0) * (|00b> + |01>U^2|b> + |10b> + |11>U^2|b>)
  = |00b> + |01>U^2|b> + |10>U|b> + |11>U*U^2|b>
  = |00b> + |01>U^2|b> + |10>U|b> + |11>U^3|b>        // <= how to choose U, then reduce U^k|b> ??

// ref:

//  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester's_formula#special_case
let U(Î¸) = exp(iAÎ¸) where Î¸ = t0 / t is a tunable parameter (conventionally t0 = 2*pi), note that now U is unitary :)

U|b> = U (Î£j Î²j |uj>)       // again decompose |b> to U's eigen basis |uj>
     = Î£j Î²j U|uj>
     = Î£j Î²j Î»j|vj>         // U|vj> = Î»j|vj> if Î»j and |vj> are the i-th eigen pair of U

```

âšª Encode the equation

To make the quantum evolution framework work, it requires `U` to be **unitary** while `b` to be a **normalized vector**. However, `A` and `b` are **arbitarily** given from a linear equation, this is why the encoding step is necessary in most casual cases.  

Firstly, follow this to transform an **arbitary** linear equation to suit valid quantum gate and state:

```
                  Ax = b
           (P D Q) x = b               // svd, where D is diagonal
             D (Q x) = P' * b          // matrix inversion & associative law
          D (Q/C1 x) = P' * b / C1     // dividing by C1 at both side, making right side a unit vector (let scalar C1 = |P' b|)
  (D/C2) (Q/C1*C2 x) = P' * b / C1     // abstract factor C2 at left side, making D/C2 a hermitian matrix (let matrix C2 = inv(D))
```

Then, use universal rotaion gate to encode the `U` and `b`:

```
```
